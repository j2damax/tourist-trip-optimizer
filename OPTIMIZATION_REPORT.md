## Executive Summary

This report presents a comprehensive analysis of the Tourist Trip Design Problem (TTDP), formulated as a variant of the Orienteering Problem. The study implements and compares two optimization approaches: a Genetic Algorithm (GA) metaheuristic and a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) exact method. Using a dataset of 953 Sri Lankan tourist attractions, we optimized itineraries for a 24-hour time constraint. Results demonstrate that while GA provides near-optimal solutions rapidly (0.24 seconds), MIP guarantees optimality but requires significantly more computation time (299.89 seconds). Both methods successfully identified tours visiting 6 attractions with scores of 555.0 (GA) and 558.0 (MIP), representing a 0.54% optimality gap.

## 1. Problem Definition & Literature Review (15%)

### 1.1 Problem Statement

The Tourist Trip Design Problem (TTDP) aims to maximize tourist satisfaction by selecting and sequencing attractions within a constrained time budget. This problem is formulated as a variant of the Orienteering Problem (OP), a well-studied combinatorial optimization problem in operations research.

### 1.2 Mathematical Formulation

**Decision Variables:**
- x_i ∈ {0, 1}: Binary variable indicating whether attraction i is visited
- y_ij ∈ {0, 1}: Binary variable indicating whether we travel from attraction i to j
- u_i ∈ ℝ⁺: Continuous variable representing the position of attraction i in the tour (for subtour elimination)

**Objective Function:**

max Z = Σ(i=1 to n) s_i · x_i

Where:
- n: Total number of attractions
- s_i: Satisfaction score for attraction i

**Constraints:**

1. **Time Constraint (Nonlinear):**
   Σ(i=1 to n) d_i · x_i + Σ(i=1 to n)Σ(j=1,j≠i to n) (dist_ij/v) · y_ij ≤ T_max
   
   Where:
   - d_i: Visit duration for attraction i (hours)
   - dist_ij: Distance between attractions i and j (km)
   - v: Average travel speed (50 km/h)
   - T_max: Maximum available time (24 hours)

2. **Flow Conservation Constraints:**
   Σ(j=1,j≠i to n) y_ij = x_i, ∀i ∈ {1, ..., n}
   Σ(j=1,j≠i to n) y_ji = x_i, ∀i ∈ {1, ..., n}

3. **Subtour Elimination (Miller-Tucker-Zemlin):**
   u_i - u_j + n · y_ij ≤ n - 1, ∀i, j ∈ {1, ..., n}, i ≠ j

4. **Binary and Non-negativity Constraints:**
   x_i ∈ {0, 1}, y_ij ∈ {0, 1}, u_i ≥ 0

**Problem Characteristics:**
- **Type:** NP-Hard combinatorial optimization problem
- **Objective:** Linear (maximization)
- **Constraints:** Mix of linear and nonlinear inequalities
- **Variables:** Binary (x_i, y_ij) and continuous (u_i)
- **Complexity:** O(n!) possible tour sequences for n attractions

| Visit Duration (hours) | 1.0 | 3.0 | 2.0 | 0.58 |
| Latitude | 5.92°N | 9.83°N | 7.87°N | 1.12° |
| Longitude | 79.85°E | 81.88°E | 80.77°E | 0.59° |

### 2.2 Data Preprocessing

**Step 1: Data Validation**
- Verified all 953 records have complete information
- Confirmed geographic coordinates within Sri Lankan boundaries
- Validated score and duration ranges

**Step 2: Distance Matrix Calculation**
- Computed pairwise distances using Haversine formula
- Formula: d = 2r·arcsin(√(sin²(Δφ/2) + cosφ₁·cosφ₂·sin²(Δλ/2)))
- Where: r = Earth's radius (6,371 km), φ = latitude, λ = longitude
- Result: 953 × 953 distance matrix (7.3 MB)

**Step 3: Travel Time Matrix**
- Converted distances to travel times using average speed of 50 km/h
- Travel time (hours) = Distance (km) / 50
- Accounts for Sri Lankan road conditions and average tourist travel patterns

**Step 4: Problem Size Reduction for Experiments**
- Selected top 30 attractions by interest score for computational efficiency
- Score range of subset: 90.0 - 95.0 (premium attractions)
- Reduces problem complexity while maintaining representativeness
- Enables comparison of both algorithms within reasonable time limits

### 2.3 Challenges Identified

#### 2.3.1 Combinatorial Complexity
- **Challenge:** With 953 attractions, the solution space is approximately 953! ≈ 10²³⁹² possible tours
- **Impact:** Exhaustive search computationally infeasible
- **Mitigation:** Used subset (30 attractions) for experiments; 30! ≈ 2.65 × 10³² still requires intelligent search

#### 2.3.2 Time Constraint Tightness
- **Challenge:** 24-hour constraint limits tours to 6-8 attractions on average
- **Impact:** High constraint tightness increases problem difficulty
- **Analysis:** Average visit takes 2 hours + travel time; constraint allows only ~10% of attractions

#### 2.3.3 Geographic Sparsity
- **Challenge:** Attractions distributed across entire island (300 km × 140 km)
- **Impact:** Long travel times between distant attractions
- **Implication:** Tour sequencing critical for feasibility

#### 2.3.4 Multi-Objective Nature
- **Challenge:** Trade-off between maximizing score and minimizing travel time
- **Impact:** High-score attractions may be geographically dispersed
- **Approach:** Single objective (score) with time as hard constraint
