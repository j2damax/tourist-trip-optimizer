# Quick Start Guide

**New to optimization?** Get started in 15 minutes!

## Option 1: Interactive Tutorial (Recommended for Beginners)

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Run the beginner tutorial
cd examples
python beginner_tutorial.py

# 3. Open the interactive notebook
jupyter notebook ../notebooks/05_Interactive_Learning_Tutorial.ipynb
```

**Time needed**: 15-30 minutes  
**What you'll learn**: How GA works, step by step

## Option 2: Read the Learning Guide

Open [`LEARNING_GUIDE.md`](LEARNING_GUIDE.md) and start with:
- Section 1: Introduction to Optimization (10 min)
- Section 2: Core Concepts (20 min)
- Section 5: Step-by-Step Genetic Algorithm (30 min)

**Time needed**: 1 hour  
**What you'll learn**: Theory and concepts behind optimization

## Option 3: Jump Right In

```bash
# Run the full GA implementation
jupyter notebook notebooks/02_Genetic_Algorithm_Implementation.ipynb
```

**Time needed**: 5 minutes to run  
**Best for**: Learning by experimentation

## Learning Path

```
Day 1 (2 hours):
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Read LEARNING_GUIDE.md sections 1-2
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Run examples/beginner_tutorial.py
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Try exercises in section 8

Day 2 (2 hours):
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Read LEARNING_GUIDE.md sections 5-6
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Run notebooks/05_Interactive_Learning_Tutorial.ipynb
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Experiment with parameters

Day 3 (2 hours):
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Run notebooks/02_Genetic_Algorithm_Implementation.ipynb
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Run notebooks/03_MIP_Model_Benchmark.ipynb
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Compare results

Week 2-3:
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Follow the 3-week roadmap in LEARNING_GUIDE.md section 9
```

## Common Questions

**Q: I have no optimization background. Where do I start?**  
A: Start with `examples/beginner_tutorial.py`, then read LEARNING_GUIDE.md section 1-2.

**Q: What's the difference between GA and MIP?**  
A: GA is fast and finds good solutions. MIP is slower but finds optimal solutions. See LEARNING_GUIDE.md section 7.

**Q: Can I use this for my own problem?**  
A: Yes! See LEARNING_GUIDE.md section 8 (exercises) for examples.

**Q: How long does it take to learn?**  
A: Basics: 1 week. Proficiency: 2-3 weeks. Mastery: 2-3 months of practice.
