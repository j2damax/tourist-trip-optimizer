## Overview

The Tourist Trip Optimizer provides two complementary approaches for planning optimal tourist itineraries:

- **Genetic Algorithm (GA)**: Fast, scalable, near-optimal solutions for large problem instances
- **Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP)**: Provably optimal solutions for smaller problem instances

Both methods are demonstrated through real-world use cases using Sri Lankan tourist attractions data (953 POIs).

### Quick Reference: Which Solver to Use?

#### Choose Genetic Algorithm If:
✅ You have 50+ POIs to consider  
✅ You need results in seconds to minutes  
✅ You want interactive, real-time planning  
✅ Near-optimal solutions are acceptable (99%+ quality)  
✅ You're building a user-facing application  
✅ You want to experiment with different trip configurations  

**Example scenarios:**
- Tourist mobile app with live itinerary planning
- Travel agency with large POI databases
- Multi-city, multi-day tour optimization
- Initial exploration of trip possibilities

#### Choose MIP Solver If:
✅ You need the absolute best solution  
✅ Working with pre-filtered POIs (<30)  
✅ You can wait seconds to minutes  
✅ Solution quality must be proven/certified  
✅ Planning high-value, once-in-lifetime trips  
✅ Budget justification is required  

**Example scenarios:**
- Premium luxury tour planning
- Corporate VIP itineraries
- Specialized themed tours (e.g., UNESCO sites only)
- Final optimization of pre-selected attractions

### Hybrid Approach (Recommended)

For best results, consider a two-stage approach:

1. **Stage 1 - GA Exploration:** 
   - Use GA to quickly explore large POI database
   - Filter down to top 30-50 candidate attractions
   - Identify promising routes and combinations

2. **Stage 2 - MIP Refinement:**
   - Apply MIP to the filtered candidate set
   - Get provably optimal final itinerary
   - Guarantee best possible solution from shortlist

This combines GA's scalability with MIP's optimality guarantees!

### Parameter Tuning Tips

**For Genetic Algorithm:**
- **Population size (200-500):** Larger for complex problems
- **Generations (300-1000):** More for higher quality
- **Crossover rate (0.7-0.9):** Higher for exploration
- **Mutation rate (0.01-0.05):** Lower for stable convergence
- **Tournament size (3-5):** Higher for selective pressure

**For MIP Solver:**
- **Time limit:** Set based on urgency (60-300 seconds typical)
- **POI subset size:** Keep under 30 for reasonable solve times
- **Pre-filtering:** Use ratings, categories to reduce problem size
