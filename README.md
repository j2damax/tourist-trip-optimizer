## Overview

This project implements optimization algorithms to solve the Tourist Trip Design Problem (TTDP), which aims to maximize tourist satisfaction by selecting and sequencing attractions within time constraints. The implementation includes both a Genetic Algorithm (GA) and a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) approach for comparison.

### Key Results

- **Genetic Algorithm:** 0.24 seconds, score 555.00 (99.46% of optimal)
- **MIP (Optimal):** 299.89 seconds, score 558.00 (100% optimal, proven)
- **Performance:** GA is 1,249Ã— faster with only 0.54% quality gap
- **Recommendation:** Use GA for real-world applications (scalable, fast, near-optimal)

### Using the Python Modules

#### Genetic Algorithm

```python
from scripts.data_utils import load_attractions_data, calculate_distance_matrix
from scripts.ga_core import GeneticAlgorithm
from scripts.visualization import plot_route_on_map

# Load data
attractions = load_attractions_data('data/sri_lanka_attractions.csv')
distance_matrix = calculate_distance_matrix(attractions)

# Run Genetic Algorithm
ga = GeneticAlgorithm(
    distance_matrix=distance_matrix,
    scores=attractions['score'].values,
    visit_durations=attractions['visit_duration'].values,
    max_time=24,
    population_size=100,
    generations=500
)

solution, fitness, history = ga.evolve()
tour = ga.get_valid_tour(solution)

# Visualize results
plot_route_on_map(attractions, tour, 'tour_map.html')
```

#### MIP Solver

```python
from scripts.data_utils import load_attractions_data
from scripts.mip_solver import MIPSolver
import numpy as np

# Load data
attractions = load_attractions_data('data/processed/attractions.csv')
distance_matrix = np.load('data/processed/distance_matrix.npy')

# Create and solve MIP model
solver = MIPSolver(
    distance_matrix=distance_matrix,
    scores=attractions['interest_score'].values,
    visit_durations=attractions['visit_duration'].values,
    max_time=24.0,
    avg_speed=50.0
)

solver.build_model()
solution = solver.solve(time_limit=300)  # 5 minute limit
solver.print_solution(attractions)
```

## Problem Formulation

The Tourist Trip Design Problem is formulated as an Orienteering Problem variant:

**Objective**: Maximize total satisfaction score from visited attractions

**Constraints**:
- Total time (travel + visit) â‰¤ maximum allowed time
- Each attraction visited at most once
- Valid tour sequence (no subtours)

## Algorithms

### Genetic Algorithm
- Population-based metaheuristic
- Tournament selection
- Order crossover (OX)
- Swap mutation
- Configurable parameters (population size, generations, rates)

### Mixed Integer Programming
- Exact optimization approach
- MTZ subtour elimination constraints
- Solved using CBC solver
- Provides optimal or near-optimal solutions with guarantees

## Results

Both algorithms are benchmarked on solution quality and computation time. The GA typically provides good solutions quickly, while MIP can find optimal solutions but may require more time for larger instances.
