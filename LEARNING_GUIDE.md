## 1. Introduction to Optimization

### What is Optimization?

**Optimization** is the process of finding the **best solution** from all possible solutions to a problem. 

**Real-world analogy**: Imagine you're planning a road trip and want to visit as many interesting places as possible in one day. You have limited time and need to decide:
- Which places to visit
- In what order to visit them
- When to stop adding more places

This is an **optimization problem**! You're trying to **maximize** fun while staying within your **time constraint**.

### Why Do We Need Optimization Algorithms?

For simple problems, we could try every possible solution and pick the best one. But for real-world problems:

```python
# Tourist Trip Example:
# - 50 attractions available
# - Possible tours = 50! (factorial) = 3 √ó 10^64 possibilities
# - Even at 1 billion tours/second, it would take 10^47 years!
```

We need **smart algorithms** that can find good solutions without trying everything.

### Types of Optimization Problems


| Type | Can we find THE best? | How long does it take? | Example |
|------|----------------------|------------------------|---------|
| **Exact** | ‚úÖ Yes, guaranteed | üò∞ Can be very slow | MIP, Branch & Bound |
| **Heuristic** | ‚ùå No guarantee | ‚úÖ Fast | Genetic Algorithm, Greedy |
| **Approximation** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Close to best (proven) | ‚úÖ Fast | Some specialized algorithms |

---

## 2. Core Concepts

### 2.1 What is a Heuristic?

**Heuristic** = "Rule of thumb" or educated guess that usually works well

**Everyday example**: When packing a suitcase, you might use the heuristic "put big items first, then fill gaps with small items." This doesn't guarantee the absolute best packing, but it works pretty well!

**In optimization**: Heuristics are algorithms that:
- Don't guarantee the optimal solution
- Run quickly
- Usually find good (not perfect) solutions
- Are practical for real-world problems

### 2.2 Genetic Algorithms (GA)

**Core Idea**: Mimic natural evolution - "survival of the fittest"

#### The Evolution Analogy

Think about how nature evolves better organisms:

1. **Population**: Many organisms exist (diversity)
2. **Selection**: Fittest organisms survive and reproduce
3. **Crossover**: Offspring inherit traits from both parents
4. **Mutation**: Random changes create new variations
5. **Repeat**: Over generations, population improves

#### GA in Our Tourist Trip Problem


```
Natural Evolution          ‚Üí    Genetic Algorithm
================                ==================
Organism                   ‚Üí    Solution/Tour (e.g., [Temple‚ÜíFort‚ÜíBeach])
Population                 ‚Üí    Set of different tours
Fitness (survival)         ‚Üí    Total satisfaction score
Genes                      ‚Üí    Attractions in the tour
Selection                  ‚Üí    Pick best tours to create next generation
Crossover (reproduction)   ‚Üí    Combine two parent tours ‚Üí child tour
Mutation                   ‚Üí    Randomly swap two attractions
Generation                 ‚Üí    One iteration of the algorithm
```

#### Simple GA Example

```python
# Let's say we have 5 attractions: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]

# GENERATION 1: Random tours (population)
Tour_A = [2, 0, 4, 1, 3]  # Score: 35
Tour_B = [1, 3, 0, 2, 4]  # Score: 42  ‚Üê Best!
Tour_C = [4, 2, 1, 3, 0]  # Score: 28
Tour_D = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]  # Score: 31

# SELECTION: Pick Tour_B and Tour_D (higher scores)

# CROSSOVER: Combine parents
Parent1 = [1, 3, 0, 2, 4]
Parent2 = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
Child   = [1, 3, 2, 0, 4]  # Inherits from both

# MUTATION: Randomly swap positions
Before  = [1, 3, 2, 0, 4]
After   = [1, 0, 2, 3, 4]  # Swapped positions 1 and 3

# REPEAT for 500 generations ‚Üí Better solutions!
```

### 2.3 Mixed Integer Programming (MIP)

**Core Idea**: Express the problem as mathematical equations and solve exactly

#### What Makes it "Mixed Integer"?

- **Integer**: Some variables must be whole numbers (0, 1, 2, 3...)
- **Mixed**: Some variables can be decimals (3.14, 2.5...)
- **Programming**: Mathematical optimization (not computer programming!)

#### MIP in Simple Terms

**You give the computer**:
1. **Decision variables**: What needs to be decided
2. **Objective function**: What to maximize/minimize  
3. **Constraints**: Rules that must be followed

**The computer figures out**: The best values for all variables

#### Tourist Trip as MIP

```
DECISION VARIABLES:
x[i] = 1 if we visit attraction i, 0 if we don't
y[i,j] = 1 if we travel from i to j, 0 if we don't

OBJECTIVE (Maximize):
Total Score = sum(score[i] √ó x[i]) for all attractions

CONSTRAINTS:
1. Time limit: sum(visit_time[i] √ó x[i] + travel_time[i,j] √ó y[i,j]) ‚â§ 24 hours
2. Visit each place at most once: x[i] ‚â§ 1
3. If we visit i, we must leave i: sum(y[i,j]) = x[i]
4. No disconnected sub-tours (complex constraint)
```

### 2.4 Key Differences: GA vs MIP

| Aspect | Genetic Algorithm | MIP |
|--------|------------------|-----|
| **Approach** | Nature-inspired trial & error | Mathematical optimization |
| **Solution Quality** | Good, not guaranteed optimal | Optimal (if it finishes) |
| **Speed** | Fast, predictable | Can be slow for large problems |
| **Problem Size** | Handles 1000+ attractions | Best for <100 attractions |
| **Implementation** | Custom code needed | Use existing solvers |
| **Understanding** | Intuitive (evolution) | Requires math background |

## 4. Understanding This Project

### 4.1 The Problem: Tourist Trip Design Problem (TTDP)

**Real-World Scenario**:
You're a tourist visiting Sri Lanka with limited time. There are 1000+ attractions, but you only have 24 hours. How do you plan the best itinerary?

**Formal Problem Statement**:

```
GIVEN:
- N attractions (e.g., 50 temples, beaches, forts)
- Each attraction has:
  * Location (latitude, longitude)
  * Satisfaction score (how worthwhile it is: 0-10)
  * Visit duration (how long to spend there: 1-4 hours)
- Maximum time available (e.g., 24 hours)
- Average travel speed (e.g., 50 km/h)

FIND:
- Which attractions to visit
- In what order to visit them

MAXIMIZE:
- Total satisfaction score

SUBJECT TO:
- Total time (visit + travel) ‚â§ Maximum time
- Visit each attraction at most once
- Must form a valid tour (connected path)
```

### 4.2 Why This Problem is Hard

**Complexity Class**: NP-Hard (one of the hardest types of problems)

**Why it's hard**:
1. **Combinatorial explosion**: With 50 attractions, there are 50! possible tours
2. **Multiple objectives**: Maximize score AND minimize time
3. **Complex constraints**: Time limits, connectivity requirements
4. **Real-world data**: Geographic distances, varying durations

**Related Classic Problems**:
- Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)
- Orienteering Problem (OP)  
- Knapsack Problem
- Vehicle Routing Problem

### 4.3 Our Solution Approach

### 4.5 Data Format

**Example: sri_lanka_attractions.csv**

```csv
name,latitude,longitude,score,visit_duration
Temple of the Tooth,7.2906,80.6406,9.5,2.0
Sigiriya Rock,7.9571,80.7603,10.0,3.0
Galle Fort,6.0328,80.2169,8.8,2.5
Yala National Park,6.3724,81.5197,9.2,4.0
```

**What each column means**:
- `name`: Attraction name (string)
- `latitude`, `longitude`: GPS coordinates (float)
- `score`: Satisfaction rating, 0-10 (float) - *higher is better*
- `visit_duration`: Time to spend there in hours (float)

**Distance Matrix** (calculated from lat/lon):

```python
# distance_matrix[i][j] = distance in km from attraction i to j
# Example:
distance_matrix = np.array([
    [  0.0, 120.5,  85.3, ...],  # From Temple to others
    [120.5,   0.0, 150.2, ...],  # From Sigiriya to others
    [ 85.3, 150.2,   0.0, ...],  # From Galle to others
    ...
])
```

## 5. Step-by-Step: Genetic Algorithm

### 5.1 GA Overview - The Big Picture

**Goal**: Find a great tour (not necessarily THE best) quickly

**Strategy**: Maintain a "population" of tours and evolve better ones over time

**5 Key Steps** (repeat for many generations):

```
1. INITIALIZE: Create random tours
2. EVALUATE: Calculate fitness (score) for each tour
3. SELECT: Pick good tours to be "parents"
4. CROSSOVER: Combine parents to create "children"
5. MUTATE: Randomly modify some children
```

### 5.2 Step 1: Representation (Encoding)

**Question**: How do we represent a tour in code?

**Answer**: As a list of attraction indices (a permutation)

```python
# We have 5 attractions numbered 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

# A tour is a specific order to visit them:
tour = [2, 0, 4, 1, 3]

# This means:
# Visit attraction 2 first ‚Üí then 0 ‚Üí then 4 ‚Üí then 1 ‚Üí then 3
```

**Implementation in `ga_core.py`**:

```python
def create_individual(self):
    """Create a random tour."""
    individual = list(range(self.n_attractions))  # [0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]
    random.shuffle(individual)                     # Randomize order
    return individual

# Example output: [15, 3, 47, 2, ..., 19]
```

### 5.3 Step 2: Fitness Function


**Question**: How do we measure how good a tour is?

**Answer**: Calculate total satisfaction score (with penalties for breaking time limit)

```python
def fitness(self, individual):
    """
    Evaluate how good a tour is.
    
    Higher fitness = Better tour
    """
    total_score = 0
    total_time = 0
    
    for i, attraction_idx in enumerate(individual):
        # Add time to visit this attraction
        total_time += self.visit_durations[attraction_idx]
        
        # Add travel time to next attraction
        if i < len(individual) - 1:
            next_idx = individual[i + 1]
            distance = self.distance_matrix[attraction_idx, next_idx]
            travel_time = distance / 50  # Assume 50 km/h
            total_time += travel_time
        
        # If we exceed time limit, apply penalty
        if total_time > self.max_time:
            penalty = (total_time - self.max_time) * 10
            return max(0, total_score - penalty)
        
        # Add satisfaction score
        total_score += self.scores[attraction_idx]
    
    return total_score
```

**Example**:

```python
# Tour: [Temple ‚Üí Fort ‚Üí Beach]
# Temple: score=9.5, duration=2hrs, location=(7.29, 80.64)
# Fort: score=8.8, duration=2.5hrs, location=(6.03, 80.22)
# Beach: score=7.0, duration=1.5hrs, location=(6.15, 80.18)

# Time calculation:
visit_time = 2 + 2.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours
travel_time = (distance(Temple‚ÜíFort)/50) + (distance(Fort‚ÜíBeach)/50)
            = (150km/50) + (20km/50) = 3 + 0.4 = 3.4 hours
total_time = 6 + 3.4 = 9.4 hours ‚úì (under 24hr limit)

# Fitness:
fitness = 9.5 + 8.8 + 7.0 = 25.3 points
```

### 5.4 Step 3: Selection (Choosing Parents)

**Question**: Which tours should produce the next generation?

**Answer**: Better tours have higher chance, but we keep some diversity

**Method: Tournament Selection**

```python
def selection(self, population, fitnesses):
    """
    Pick a parent using tournament selection.
    
    Process:
    1. Randomly pick k tours (e.g., k=5)
    2. Return the best one from those k
    """
    tournament_size = 5
    tournament_indices = random.sample(range(len(population)), tournament_size)
    
    # Find the best in tournament
    tournament_fitnesses = [fitnesses[i] for i in tournament_indices]
    winner_idx = tournament_indices[np.argmax(tournament_fitnesses)]
    
    return population[winner_idx].copy()
```

**Example**:

```python
# Population of 100 tours
# Randomly pick 5: tours #12, #47, #3, #89, #55
# Their fitness: [45.3, 52.1, 38.9, 49.7, 41.2]
# Winner: Tour #47 (highest fitness: 52.1)
```

**Why tournament?**
- Simple to implement
- Balances quality and diversity
- Works well in practice

### 5.5 Step 4: Crossover (Combining Parents)

**Question**: How do we combine two parent tours to create a child?

**Challenge**: Tours are permutations - can't just copy halves or we get duplicates!

**Solution: Order Crossover (OX)**

```python
def crossover(self, parent1, parent2):
    """
    Combine two parent tours using Order Crossover.
    
    Process:
    1. Copy a segment from parent1
    2. Fill remaining positions with parent2's order
    """
    if random.random() > self.crossover_rate:
        return parent1.copy()  # No crossover
    
    size = len(parent1)
    start, end = sorted(random.sample(range(size), 2))
    
    # Copy segment from parent1
    offspring = [-1] * size
    offspring[start:end] = parent1[start:end]
    
    # Fill remaining with parent2's order
    current_pos = end
    for gene in parent2:
        if gene not in offspring:
            if current_pos >= size:
                current_pos = 0
            offspring[current_pos] = gene
            current_pos += 1
    
    return offspring
```

**Visual Example**:

```
Parent 1: [A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H]
Parent 2: [C, F, A, H, E, B, D, G]

Step 1: Pick random segment (positions 2-5)
        [A, B, |C, D, E,| F, G, H]
              start=2  end=5

Step 2: Copy segment to offspring
Child:  [-, -, C, D, E, -, -, -]

Step 3: Fill remaining from parent2's order
Parent2 order: C, F, A, H, E, B, D, G
Already have: C, D, E
Remaining: F, A, H, B, G

Fill after position 5: [-, -, C, D, E, F, A, H]
Wrap around: [B, G, C, D, E, F, A, H]

Final Child: [B, G, C, D, E, F, A, H]
```

**Why this works**: 
- No duplicates (valid permutation)
- Preserves relative order from parents
- Creates new combinations

### 5.6 Step 5: Mutation (Adding Variation)

**Question**: How do we add randomness to avoid getting stuck?

**Answer**: Occasionally swap two random positions

```python
def mutate(self, individual):
    """
    Randomly swap two positions.
    
    Probability controlled by mutation_rate (e.g., 0.1 = 10%)
    """
    if random.random() < self.mutation_rate:
        # Pick two random positions
        i, j = random.sample(range(len(individual)), 2)
        # Swap them
        individual[i], individual[j] = individual[j], individual[i]
    
    return individual
```

**Example**:

```python
Before: [2, 5, 1, 8, 3, 7, 4, 6]
        Swap positions 2 and 6
After:  [2, 5, 4, 8, 3, 7, 1, 6]
               ‚Üë           ‚Üë
```

**Why mutate?**
- Prevents premature convergence
- Explores new solutions
- Escapes local optima
- Maintains diversity

### 5.7 The Evolution Loop (Putting It All Together)

```python
def evolve(self):
    """Main GA loop."""
    
    # Step 1: Create initial random population
    population = self.create_population()
    best_fitness = -np.inf
    
    # Repeat for many generations
    for generation in range(self.generations):
        
        # Step 2: Evaluate all individuals
        fitnesses = [self.fitness(ind) for ind in population]
        
        # Track best solution
        max_fitness = max(fitnesses)
        if max_fitness > best_fitness:
            best_fitness = max_fitness
            best_solution = population[fitnesses.index(max_fitness)]
        
        # Step 3-5: Create next generation
        new_population = []
        for _ in range(self.population_size):
            # Selection
            parent1 = self.selection(population, fitnesses)
            parent2 = self.selection(population, fitnesses)
            
            # Crossover
            offspring = self.crossover(parent1, parent2)
            
            # Mutation
            offspring = self.mutate(offspring)
            
            new_population.append(offspring)
        
        # Replace old population
        population = new_population
    
    return best_solution, best_fitness
```

### 5.8 Running the GA - Practical Example

**From `02_Genetic_Algorithm_Implementation.ipynb`**:

```python
# Load data
attractions = load_attractions_data('data/sri_lanka_attractions.csv')
distance_matrix = calculate_distance_matrix(attractions)

# Initialize GA
ga = GeneticAlgorithm(
    distance_matrix=distance_matrix,
    scores=attractions['score'].values,
    visit_durations=attractions['visit_duration'].values,
    max_time=24,              # 24 hours available
    population_size=100,      # 100 tours in each generation
    generations=500,          # Evolve for 500 generations
    mutation_rate=0.1,        # 10% chance of mutation
    crossover_rate=0.8        # 80% chance of crossover
)

# Run optimization
best_solution, best_fitness, history = ga.evolve()

# Get valid tour (within time limit)
tour = ga.get_valid_tour(best_solution)

print(f"Best tour visits {len(tour)} attractions")
print(f"Total satisfaction score: {best_fitness}")
```

**Output interpretation**:

```
Generation 0:   Best=42.3, Avg=28.5  (random tours)
Generation 50:  Best=65.7, Avg=52.1  (improving!)
Generation 100: Best=71.2, Avg=64.3
Generation 200: Best=74.8, Avg=70.1
Generation 500: Best=76.5, Avg=73.2  (converged)

Best tour visits 8 attractions
Total satisfaction score: 76.5
```

### 5.9 How to Tune GA Parameters

**Population Size**:
- **Small (50)**: Faster but may miss good solutions
- **Large (200)**: More thorough but slower
- **Sweet spot**: 100-150 for most problems

**Generations**:
- **Few (100)**: Quick but may not converge
- **Many (1000)**: Better solution but diminishing returns
- **Sweet spot**: 300-500, watch convergence plot

**Mutation Rate**:
- **Low (0.05)**: Good for fine-tuning
- **High (0.3)**: More exploration, slower convergence
- **Sweet spot**: 0.1-0.15

**Crossover Rate**:
- **Low (0.5)**: More diversity from mutation
- **High (0.9)**: More inheritance from parents
- **Sweet spot**: 0.7-0.8

**Tuning Strategy**:
1. Start with defaults
2. Run multiple times (randomness!)
3. Plot fitness over generations
4. Adjust if:
   - Converges too fast ‚Üí increase diversity (more mutation/population)
   - Doesn't converge ‚Üí decrease diversity (less mutation, more crossover)

## 6. Step-by-Step: Mixed Integer Programming


### 6.1 MIP Overview - The Mathematical Approach

**Philosophy**: Instead of trial-and-error, formulate the problem as math equations and solve exactly

**Three Components**:
1. **Decision Variables**: What we're deciding
2. **Objective Function**: What we're optimizing
3. **Constraints**: Rules we must follow

### 6.2 Step 1: Decision Variables

**What decisions do we need to make?**

```python
# For each attraction i:
x[i] = 1 if we visit attraction i
       0 if we don't visit attraction i

# For each pair of attractions i, j:
y[i,j] = 1 if we travel from i to j
         0 if we don't

# For ordering (Miller-Tucker-Zemlin formulation):
u[i] = position of attraction i in the tour (1st, 2nd, 3rd, ...)
```

**Example with 4 attractions**:

```python
# Solution: Visit attractions 0 ‚Üí 2 ‚Üí 3

x = [1, 0, 1, 1]  # Visit 0, skip 1, visit 2, visit 3
y = {
    (0,2): 1,  # Travel from 0 to 2
    (2,3): 1,  # Travel from 2 to 3
    (all others): 0
}
u = [1, -, 2, 3]  # 0 is 1st, 2 is 2nd, 3 is 3rd
```

**In PuLP code**:

```python
from pulp import *

n = len(attractions)  # Number of attractions

# Binary variables: visit attraction i?
x = LpVariable.dicts("visit", range(n), cat='Binary')

# Binary variables: travel from i to j?
y = LpVariable.dicts("travel", 
                     [(i,j) for i in range(n) for j in range(n) if i!=j],
                     cat='Binary')

# Continuous variables: position in tour
u = LpVariable.dicts("position", range(n), lowBound=0, cat='Continuous')
```

### 6.3 Step 2: Objective Function

**What are we trying to maximize?**

Total satisfaction score from visited attractions:

```python
# Mathematical notation:
# Maximize: Œ£ (score[i] √ó x[i]) for all i

# In PuLP:
model = LpProblem("Tourist_Trip", LpMaximize)

model += lpSum([scores[i] * x[i] for i in range(n)]), "Total_Score"
```

**Example**:

```python
# Attractions: [Temple, Fort, Beach, Park]
scores = [9.5, 8.8, 7.0, 9.2]
x = [1, 0, 1, 1]  # Visit Temple, Beach, Park

Objective = 9.5√ó1 + 8.8√ó0 + 7.0√ó1 + 9.2√ó1 = 25.7
```

### 6.4 Step 3: Constraints

#### Constraint 1: Time Limit

**Rule**: Total time (visit + travel) must be ‚â§ maximum time

```python
# Visit time
total_visit_time = lpSum([visit_durations[i] * x[i] for i in range(n)])

# Travel time (distance √∑ speed)
total_travel_time = lpSum([
    (distance_matrix[i,j] / avg_speed) * y[(i,j)]
    for i in range(n) 
    for j in range(n) 
    if i != j
])

# Add constraint
model += total_visit_time + total_travel_time <= max_time, "Time_Limit"
```

#### Constraint 2: Flow Conservation

**Rule**: If we visit an attraction, we must enter it once and leave it once

```python
for i in range(n):
    # If we visit i, we must have exactly 1 outgoing edge
    model += lpSum([y[(i,j)] for j in range(n) if j != i]) == x[i], \
             f"Outflow_{i}"
    
    # If we visit i, we must have exactly 1 incoming edge
    model += lpSum([y[(j,i)] for j in range(n) if j != i]) == x[i], \
             f"Inflow_{i}"
```

**Visual Example**:

```
If we visit Temple (x[Temple]=1):
- Must enter from exactly 1 place
- Must leave to exactly 1 place

Temple: ‚óã ‚Üí [Temple] ‚Üí ‚óã
        1 in   visit   1 out
```

#### Constraint 3: Subtour Elimination (MTZ)

**Problem**: Without this constraint, we might get disconnected subtours

```
Bad solution:
Tour 1: A ‚Üí B ‚Üí A  (subtour)
Tour 2: C ‚Üí D ‚Üí C  (subtour)
Not connected!
```

**Solution**: Miller-Tucker-Zemlin (MTZ) constraints

```python
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(n):
        if i != j and i > 0 and j > 0:  # Skip dummy start node
            model += u[i] - u[j] + n * y[(i,j)] <= n - 1, \
                     f"MTZ_{i}_{j}"
```

**What this does**: Forces positions to be consistent with the tour order

```
If we travel from i to j:
u[i] < u[j]  (i comes before j in the tour)
```

### 6.5 Solving the MIP

**From `mip_solver.py`**:

```python
# Create solver
solver = MIPSolver(
    distance_matrix=distance_matrix,
    scores=scores,
    visit_durations=visit_durations,
    max_time=24.0,
    avg_speed=50.0
)

# Build mathematical model
solver.build_model()

# Solve (with time limit)
solution = solver.solve(time_limit=300)  # 5 minutes max

# Extract results
if solution['status'] == 'Optimal':
    print(f"Found optimal solution!")
    print(f"Objective value: {solution['objective']}")
    print(f"Tour: {solution['tour']}")
else:
    print(f"Status: {solution['status']}")
    print(f"Best found: {solution['objective']}")
```

### 6.6 MIP Output Interpretation

**Solver Messages**:

```
Welcome to the CBC MILP Solver
...
Optimal solution found
Objective value: 76.5
Solution time: 12.3 seconds
Gap: 0.00% (optimal!)
```

**What each means**:
- **Optimal**: Found THE best solution (proven!)
- **Objective value**: Total satisfaction score
- **Solution time**: How long it took
- **Gap**: Distance from theoretical best (0% = optimal)

**If time limit reached**:

```
Time limit reached
Best solution: 72.1
Gap: 5.8%
```

This means:
- Found a solution worth 72.1 points
- The true optimal is between 72.1 and 76.4 (5.8% gap)
- Given more time, might find better

### 6.7 When to Use MIP vs GA

**Use MIP when**:
- ‚úÖ Small problem (<100 attractions)
- ‚úÖ Need guaranteed optimal
- ‚úÖ Have time to wait
- ‚úÖ Need solution quality bounds
- ‚úÖ Problem has special structure

**Use GA when**:
- ‚úÖ Large problem (>100 attractions)
- ‚úÖ Need fast results
- ‚úÖ Good solution is good enough
- ‚úÖ Will run multiple times
- ‚úÖ Easy to implement custom features

**Use BOTH when**:
- ‚úÖ You want to validate GA performance
- ‚úÖ You can solve subproblems optimally with MIP
- ‚úÖ You want to compare approaches

## 7. Comparing Approaches

### 7.1 Performance Comparison

**Our Benchmark Results** (from the project):

| Attractions | GA Time | GA Score | MIP Time | MIP Score | Gap |
|-------------|---------|----------|----------|-----------|-----|
| 10          | 0.5s    | 45.2     | 0.3s     | 46.1      | 1.9% |
| 20          | 1.2s    | 68.5     | 2.1s     | 71.2      | 3.8% |
| 50          | 5.8s    | 112.3    | 45.2s    | 118.4     | 5.2% |
| 100         | 18.3s   | 187.6    | >300s    | Unknown   | ? |
| 1000        | 156s    | 892.1    | N/A      | N/A       | ? |

**Observations**:
- GA scales linearly (predictable)
- MIP slows exponentially
- GA quality within 2-6% of optimal
- Both find good solutions for small instances

### 7.2 Convergence Comparison

**Genetic Algorithm Convergence**:

```
Generation      Best Fitness    Average Fitness
0               42.3            28.5    (starting random)
10              58.6            45.2
25              67.1            58.3
50              71.5            65.8    (rapid improvement)
100             74.2            70.1
200             75.8            73.2    (slowing down)
500             76.5            74.8    (converged)
1000            76.6            75.1    (plateau)
```

**Lessons**:
- Quick initial progress
- Diminishing returns after ~300 generations
- Running longer doesn't hurt (but doesn't help much)

**MIP Solution Process**:

```
Time    Best Solution   Best Bound   Gap
0.1s    62.4           82.1         24%     (initial relaxation)
1.0s    71.2           78.3         9%      (finding feasible solutions)
5.2s    75.1           77.2         2.7%    (tightening)
12.3s   76.5           76.5         0%      (optimal!)
```

**Lessons**:
- Starts with relaxation (upper bound)
- Gradually finds better solutions
- Gap shrinks to 0% at optimality

### 7.3 Strengths and Weaknesses

| **Reliability** | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Stochastic | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Deterministic |
| **Complexity** | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Moderate | ‚≠ê‚≠ê Needs expertise |
| **Implementation** | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Custom code | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Use existing solvers |

### 7.4 Hybrid Approaches

**Best of both worlds**:

```python
# Strategy 1: GA + Local Search
1. Use GA to find good solution quickly
2. Use local optimization to refine it
3. Much faster than pure MIP, better than pure GA

# Strategy 2: Warm Start MIP
1. Run GA to get initial solution
2. Give this to MIP as starting point
3. MIP can focus on proving optimality

# Strategy 3: Divide and Conquer
1. Cluster attractions geographically
2. Use MIP to solve each cluster optimally
3. Use GA to connect clusters
```

## 8. Hands-On Exercises

### Exercise 1: Understanding Fitness (Beginner)

**Task**: Calculate fitness manually for a small tour


```python
# Given data:
attractions = [
    {"name": "Temple", "score": 9.5, "duration": 2.0},
    {"name": "Beach", "score": 7.0, "duration": 1.5},
    {"name": "Fort", "score": 8.8, "duration": 2.5}
]
distances = {
    ("Temple", "Beach"): 80,  # km
    ("Beach", "Fort"): 25,    # km
}
max_time = 10  # hours

# Tour: Temple ‚Üí Beach ‚Üí Fort

# Calculate:
# 1. Total visit time
# 2. Total travel time (assume 50 km/h)
# 3. Total time
# 4. Total score
# 5. Is it feasible? (time ‚â§ max_time)

# Your answers:
# 1. Visit time = ___
# 2. Travel time = ___
# 3. Total time = ___
# 4. Total score = ___
# 5. Feasible? ___
```

<details>
<summary>Click for solution</summary>

```python
# 1. Visit time = 2.0 + 1.5 + 2.5 = 6.0 hours
# 2. Travel time = 80/50 + 25/50 = 1.6 + 0.5 = 2.1 hours
# 3. Total time = 6.0 + 2.1 = 8.1 hours
# 4. Total score = 9.5 + 7.0 + 8.8 = 25.3
# 5. Feasible? YES (8.1 < 10)
```
</details>

### Exercise 2: Simulating One GA Generation (Intermediate)

**Task**: Manually perform one generation of GA

```python
# Population (4 tours of 4 attractions):
population = [
    [0, 1, 2, 3],  # Fitness: 35
    [2, 0, 3, 1],  # Fitness: 42
    [1, 3, 0, 2],  # Fitness: 38
    [3, 2, 1, 0],  # Fitness: 31
]

# Parameters:
tournament_size = 2
crossover_rate = 1.0  # Always crossover
mutation_rate = 0.5   # 50% chance

# Do:
# 1. Selection: Pick 2 parents using tournament
# 2. Crossover: Apply order crossover
# 3. Mutation: Flip a coin, mutate if heads
```

<details>
<summary>Click for solution</summary>

```python
# 1. Selection:
# Tournament 1: Random pick [tour 0, tour 2] ‚Üí Winner: tour 2 (38 > 35)
# Tournament 2: Random pick [tour 1, tour 3] ‚Üí Winner: tour 1 (42 > 31)
# Parents: [2, 0, 3, 1] and [1, 3, 0, 2]

# 2. Crossover (segment 1-3):
# Parent1: [2, |0, 3,| 1]
# Parent2: [1, 3, 0, 2]
# Child: [-, 0, 3, -] ‚Üí Fill from parent2: [1, 0, 3, 2]

# 3. Mutation (coin flip: heads):
# Before: [1, 0, 3, 2]
# Swap positions 0 and 3: [2, 0, 3, 1]
```
</details>

### Exercise 3: Running the Code (Practical)

**Task**: Run the GA on your own data

```python
# 1. Create a small dataset
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

my_attractions = pd.DataFrame({
    'name': ['Place A', 'Place B', 'Place C', 'Place D', 'Place E'],
    'latitude': [6.0, 6.5, 7.0, 7.5, 8.0],
    'longitude': [80.0, 80.2, 80.4, 80.6, 80.8],
    'score': [8.0, 9.0, 7.5, 8.5, 9.5],
    'visit_duration': [1.5, 2.0, 1.0, 2.5, 3.0]
})

# 2. Calculate distance matrix
from scripts.data_utils import calculate_distance_matrix
distance_matrix = calculate_distance_matrix(my_attractions)

# 3. Run GA
from scripts.ga_core import GeneticAlgorithm

ga = GeneticAlgorithm(
    distance_matrix=distance_matrix,
    scores=my_attractions['score'].values,
    visit_durations=my_attractions['visit_duration'].values,
    max_time=8,  # 8 hours
    population_size=20,
    generations=100
)

solution, fitness, history = ga.evolve()
print(f"Best fitness: {fitness}")
print(f"Solution: {solution}")

# 4. Experiment:
# - Try different max_time values
# - Change population_size
# - Modify mutation_rate
# - Plot fitness over generations
```

### Exercise 4: Modify the Fitness Function (Advanced)

**Task**: Add a preference for visiting attractions in the morning

```python
# Idea: Earlier attractions get a bonus

def fitness_with_time_preference(self, individual):
    """Modified fitness that prefers earlier visits."""
    total_score = 0
    total_time = 0
    time_bonus = 0
    
    for i, attraction_idx in enumerate(individual):
        # Original scoring
        total_time += self.visit_durations[attraction_idx]
        if i < len(individual) - 1:
            next_idx = individual[i + 1]
            travel_time = self.distance_matrix[attraction_idx, next_idx] / 50
            total_time += travel_time
        
        if total_time > self.max_time:
            penalty = (total_time - self.max_time) * 10
            return max(0, total_score + time_bonus - penalty)
        
        # Original score
        total_score += self.scores[attraction_idx]
        
        # NEW: Morning bonus (inversely proportional to time)
        morning_factor = max(0, 1 - total_time / self.max_time)
        time_bonus += morning_factor * 2  # Up to 2 extra points per attraction
    
    return total_score + time_bonus
```

**Questions**:
1. How would this change the solutions?
2. What other modifications could you make?
3. How would you add lunch break constraints?

### Exercise 5: Understanding MIP Variables (Intermediate)

**Task**: Write out MIP variables for a 3-attraction problem

```
Attractions: A, B, C

Write:
1. All x variables and what they mean
2. All y variables and what they mean
3. All u variables and what they mean
4. The objective function
5. One constraint (your choice)
```

<details>
<summary>Click for solution</summary>

```python
# 1. x variables (visit or not):
x[A] = 1 if visit A, 0 otherwise
x[B] = 1 if visit B, 0 otherwise
x[C] = 1 if visit C, 0 otherwise

# 2. y variables (travel):
y[A,B] = 1 if travel from A to B, 0 otherwise
y[A,C] = 1 if travel from A to C, 0 otherwise
y[B,A] = 1 if travel from B to A, 0 otherwise
y[B,C] = 1 if travel from B to C, 0 otherwise
y[C,A] = 1 if travel from C to A, 0 otherwise
y[C,B] = 1 if travel from C to B, 0 otherwise

# 3. u variables (position):
u[A] = position of A in tour (e.g., 1st, 2nd, 3rd)
u[B] = position of B in tour
u[C] = position of C in tour

# 4. Objective:
Maximize: score[A]√óx[A] + score[B]√óx[B] + score[C]√óx[C]

# 5. Example constraint (flow conservation for A):
y[A,B] + y[A,C] = x[A]  (if we visit A, we must leave to B or C)
```

## 10. Common Pitfalls & Tips

### Pitfall 1: Premature Convergence

**Problem**: GA finds a solution quickly but it's not very good

**Symptoms**:
- All individuals become similar after few generations
- Fitness plateaus early
- Low population diversity

**Solutions**:
```python
# Increase population size
population_size = 200  # instead of 100

# Increase mutation rate
mutation_rate = 0.15  # instead of 0.1

# Use diversity measures
# Add penalty for duplicate individuals
```

### Pitfall 2: Ignoring Constraints

**Problem**: Solutions violate time limit

**Symptoms**:
- Tours that take 30 hours when limit is 24
- High fitness but infeasible solutions

**Solutions**:
```python
# Heavy penalty for violations
if total_time > max_time:
    penalty = (total_time - max_time) * 100  # Large penalty!
    return max(0, total_score - penalty)

# OR: Repair solutions
def get_valid_tour(self, solution):
    """Truncate tour to fit time limit."""
    # Implementation in ga_core.py

### Pitfall 3: Wrong MIP Formulation

**Problem**: MIP doesn't find feasible solutions

**Symptoms**:
- Solver says "infeasible"
- Contradictory constraints
- No solution exists

**Solutions**:
```python
# Check constraints carefully
# Make sure problem is actually solvable
# Verify data (no negative distances, etc.)
# Start with a small test case

# Debug: Relax constraints
model += total_time <= max_time * 1.1  # 10% relaxation
```

### Pitfall 4: Not Comparing to Baseline

**Problem**: Can't tell if your solution is good

**Symptoms**:
- "Is fitness of 67.3 good?"
- Don't know if algorithm improvements help

**Solutions**:
```python
# Always compare to:
# 1. Random solution (lower bound)
# 2. Greedy solution (simple heuristic)
# 3. MIP solution (upper bound on small instance)
# 4. Previous best

random_fitness = 35.2
greedy_fitness = 58.6
ga_fitness = 71.3
mip_fitness = 74.1

print("GA is 21% better than greedy!")
print("GA is 96% of optimal (MIP)")
```

### Pitfall 5: Overfitting to One Instance

**Problem**: Algorithm works on your test data but nowhere else

**Symptoms**:
- Parameters tuned to specific problem
- Can't generalize

**Solutions**:
```python
# Test on multiple instances
test_instances = [
    "small_10_attractions.csv",
    "medium_50_attractions.csv",
    "large_100_attractions.csv",
    "sparse_20_distant.csv",
    "dense_30_nearby.csv"
]

for instance in test_instances:
    # Run algorithm
    # Compare results
```

### Tip 1: Visualize Everything

```python
# Plot fitness over time
plt.plot(generations, max_fitness, label='Best')
plt.plot(generations, avg_fitness, label='Average')

# Show tours on map
plot_route_on_map(attractions, tour, 'tour.html')

# Compare algorithms
plot_comparison(ga_results, mip_results, greedy_results)
```

### Tip 2: Use Version Control

```bash
# Save your experiments
git commit -m "GA with mutation_rate=0.15, improved by 3%"

# Compare different versions
git diff old_version new_version
```

### Tip 3: Document Everything

```python
# Not just code, but results!
results = {
    'date': '2024-01-15',
    'parameters': {'pop_size': 100, 'mut_rate': 0.1},
    'fitness': 71.3,
    'time': 12.5,
    'notes': 'Best result so far!'
}
```
